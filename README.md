# Notion Langchain Chatbot

## Overview

The Notion Langchain GPT LLM Chatbot is an AI-powered legal aid chatbot designed to provide legal assistance and guidance to users. It utilizes the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model developed by OpenAI to understand and generate human-like text responses. This chatbot is specifically tailored to assist with legal inquiries and questions, making it a valuable tool for individuals seeking legal advice and information.

## Features

- **Legal Expertise**: The chatbot has been trained to understand and respond to a wide range of legal questions and topics, including immigration law, intellectual property, real estate law, tax law, employment law, environmental law, family law, personal injury, banking and finance law, criminal defense, corporate law, and more.

- **Streamlit User Interface**: The chatbot is accessible through a user-friendly Streamlit web interface, making it easy for users to interact with the AI and receive legal information and suggestions.

- **Prompt-Based Interaction**: Users can input their legal questions and case descriptions as prompts, and the chatbot will generate responses and suggestions based on the provided information.

- **Lawyer Suggestions**: The chatbot can provide lawyer recommendations based on the user's case description and legal domain. It offers details about lawyers' names, expertise, locations, experience levels, success rates, and contact information.

- **Therapist Recommendations**: In addition to legal assistance, the chatbot can also recommend therapists or counselors for undertrial prisoners, providing details about their names, locations, experience, contact information, and descriptions.
